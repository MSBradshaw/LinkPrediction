# Link Prediction

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that is capable of performing gene-to-phenotype link prediction on biological knowledge graphs with performance that is comparable to methods build for for predicting different edgetypes in similar KGs. Once created this model will be used as a means of testing novel ways addressing current issues in KG link prediction for rare and undiagnosed diseases of genetic origin.
